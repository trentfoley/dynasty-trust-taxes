# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Foundation: Use brokerage CSV as primary data source; Python + pypdf as stack; fill existing IRS AcroForm PDF

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: AcroForm field names for 2025 IRS forms are unknown until `pypdf PdfReader.get_fields()` is run against the actual downloaded PDFs in `forms/` — this is a prerequisite for Phase 4 implementation
- Phase 4: Must verify 2025 Form 1041 uses AcroForm (not XFA) before starting filler work; if XFA, the PDF approach changes entirely
